<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I received my bachelor degree from School of Computer Science, Fudan University in 2021.6. After graduation, I worked as a Backend Development Engineer in Meituan, Shanghai for 2 years. Now I have quit from Meituan and try to seek my path in the academy world. My research interests lie in Computer Vison and related topics.
